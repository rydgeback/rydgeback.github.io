This is the third blog post, and the first written using this new theme. Alongside this, I also set the blog up on GitHub Pages, replacing my old Hugo based blog. Though the setup took some more time as I had to set up the GitHub Actions (something I'm not familiar with). I think the actual writing and posting process is much simpler now as I don't need to run any scripts on the local repo. I simply write up my post, then switch to the terminal, `git add`, `git commit` and then `git push`. Maybe this can be automated in a script? That is something to be explored later. I am currently using the After Dark theme, but might switch over to some other theme later on.
